This article aims to guide beginners through creating a sandbox or sandbox environment for practicing SQL. Accessing databases can be challenging for novice analysts, as it typically requires assistance from specialists or setting up databases independently, which can be daunting. 

We'll create a fully functional database using SQLite 3, a part of Python's standard library, making it easily accessible. We'll leverage Google Drive for storage and provide three methods for accessing the database.

Firstly, let's set up a SQLite 3 database, which is seamlessly integrated into Python. Accessing it should be straightforward for beginner analysts. We'll start by assuming we have a blank database and a dataset in CSV format.

To convert this dataset into a database, we'll combine multiple tables into one database. I won't delve into the database's structure intricacies, but rather focus on merging several tables into one and facilitating access. 

We'll provide two options:

1. Combining databases using pre-defined functions, merging them into one. 
2. Storing the merged database on Google Drive to access it without repeatedly merging tables.

Additionally, there's a third option for those who prefer not to mount drives frequently. We can simply download the database from a provided link.

In the next section, I'll demonstrate how to merge toy data or sample data for practicing SQL queries.
